# LinniaRealEstateDapp
Code for a Tutorial Dapp Utilizing Ethereum Blockchain, the Linnia Protocol using very simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# Tutorial
Pre-written tutorial will be added later. 

# Why does code look like this
Keeping it simple for now. Code will be refactored later into final form.

# Where to start?
Most of the code is in the single index.html file to keep things simple for now. That way person looking at tutorial will just focus on Web3 and how Linnia can be used in a case. Later on there will be another repo for refactoring code into React and React with Redux to highlight how Linnia and Web3 works with these tools.
