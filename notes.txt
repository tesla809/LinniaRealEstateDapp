    // Uploading data-
    // Note: we are using centralized storage to keep things simple
    // using existing tools.
    // Learning the basics of Web3.0, Linnia AND IPFS or Swarm
    // might be a bit much
    // To lower the learning curve, we will just use Amazon S3
    // which has great documenation.
    // Later on, we will look at how the Linnia Protocol interacts with
    // decentralized data storage like IPFS and Ethereum's Swarm(?)

    // Adding Amazon S3 storage
    // For instructions on how to set up S3, check out our docs
    // https://github.com/ConsenSys/linnia-resources/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#storing-files-on-aws-s3 (edited)
    // First, sign up for an Amazon account: https://aws.amazon.com/free/

    // Next: create access keys aka security credientials from Amazon.
    // This is a common thing in most web services
    // See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html
    // Look up top on the right. Click on Sign in to the Console button
    // Look up top on the right. Click on your Name > My Security Credentials
    // We added the keys as credentials
    // Basically, its in directory called .aws in the home directory
    // and a file called credentials which is loaded by the file
    // ~/.aws/credentials
    // see: https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/
    // You can also download the amazon CLI and use it to set up
    // your credentials
    // see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
    // A helpful guide to learn how to set up s3
    // see: https://medium.com/ovrsea/deploy-automatically-a-react-app-on-amazon-s3-iam-within-minutes-da6cb0096d55

    // Then create a bucket to put your files in
    // These instructions are in the docs.
    // Here are s3's docs on that:
    // https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html

    // Next: add the AWS JS SDK
    // Download here: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/releases
    // It has been added to the project top in a script tag
    // Later on we will use node and npm to install
    // For now, go to website, download and add to folder directory
    // to keep things simple

    // lets set up S3
    // see on how to do it here: https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/
    // not necessary since we are added S3 in script tag up top.
    // const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
